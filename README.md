# Solidary Loans

## Description

In this final project, we were asked to build a backend and a frontend for a project we created. I decided to build a webpage for people that need a loan but do not have good access to credit or the interest levels for them are too high to be able to get credit from peers. For the person giving the loan, it allows them to get a return from their savings of up to 5%.

## Backend

The back end consists of 4 microservices (User, Message, Project and Loan) an eureka server, an edge service and a config. Each microservice has at least post and get methods and some have put and delete too. The edge service is protected with JWT security. Everything has been developed in java.

## Frontend

The frontend consists on a page developed in Angular using Material design. It has 5 components. 

## Future Improvements

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get the login to work in time, meaning that all the features that depended on user could not be implemented (changing the project page, a message, investing...). I will keep working on this the following days.

Build a small app with Ionic to check your current investments.
